  Lazega: A list including six sociomatrices (three directed, three
  symmetrized) and one attributes matrix for the nodes.

  c.elegans: An symmetric valued ``sociomatrix'' for the number of
  connections between neurons.

  dolphins: A symmetric sociomatrix.
  
  prison: (Thanks to UCINET) In the 1950s John Gagnon collected
  sociometric choice data from 67 prison inmates. All were asked,
  "What fellows on the tier are you closest friends with?" Each was free
  to choose as few or as many "friends" as he desired. 

  Advice: A set of teacher advice networks from 15 different schools.
  Also includes edge.covariates which are covariates for each edge and
  SR.covariates, which are covariates for each node.
